Starting work with GitHub
Hi! My name is Nick and I want to write a little about myself. I am 18 years old, living at the sity of Kyiv. Now studying in National Technical University of Ukraine "Kyiv Politechnic Institute". Next month I will end my first year in it. I have a comlex exam ahead, and now have to study a lot. By the way I want to learn programming and started with C++ language. After 200 pages of "Thinking in C++" written by Bruce Eckel I decided to do some exercises. Because, based on my previous experience in learning programming, the best way to learn something - is to try it by your hands. 
Yesterday I was on the lecture, given by Jakov Fain, software-developer professional and not only. He was talking about communication skills, and in case about employment. Among all other he told, that nowadays string with link on your GitHUb profile could tell very much about your experience, skills, etc. So I decided to create one for me. And this is the first file, whitch I have posted on GitHub. Now I am dimly imagine what I can do with this product, and my English is so far from perfect, but I improving myself with a goal to became the best professional in this industry. Thanks for reading:)
